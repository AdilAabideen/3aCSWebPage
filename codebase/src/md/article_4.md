**Is Europe Still Striking?** In a global tech landscape dominated by the United States and China, headlines often spotlight new innovations emerging from Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. European technology stories, however, are less frequently told. But amidst this narrative, a Milan-based company has been quietly crafting a global empire. Today, we explore **Bending Spoons**, a leading European technology company known for its portfolio of popular mobile applications and its one-of-a-kind, acquisition-driven growth strategy.

### Origins and Evolution

Founded in 2013 by a group of young engineers in Copenhagen, Denmark, Bending Spoons was born from a failed product: _Evertale_, an AI-based scrapbooking app. The failure taught the team a critical lesson—rather than gambling on unproven ideas, they would identify underperforming apps with strong user potential and unlock that value through engineering excellence and business discipline. This pivot laid the foundation for a revolutionary growth model.

Headquartered in Milan under CEO Luca Ferrari, Bending Spoons is now one of Europe’s few tech unicorns, valued at **$2.55 billion** as of 2024. It boasts **over 500 million total app downloads** and around **100–200 million monthly active users** globally. Profitable from day one, the company has reinvested its earnings to fuel a remarkable journey.

### Timeline of Key Milestones

**2015–2017:** Focused on developing and optimizing a suite of iOS apps across categories like photo editing, fitness, and utilities. With a data-driven iteration process, the company reached **€45 million in annual turnover** and **200 million downloads**, becoming Europe’s #1 app publisher by volume—surpassing even Snapchat and Twitter.

**2018:** Acquired _Splice_, a mobile video editing app developed by GoPro. Under Bending Spoons, Splice became a flagship product, particularly thriving during the pandemic-era surge in creative content.

**2019:** Secured strategic minority investments (5.7% stake) from notable investors, reinforcing its global ambitions without leaving Italy. Employee count passed 100, with representation from over 15 nationalities.

**2020:** Commissioned by the Italian government to build _Immuni_, Italy’s COVID-19 contact-tracing app—demonstrating public trust in Bending Spoons’ technical capacity and civic responsibility.

**2021:** Acquired _Remini_, an AI-powered photo enhancement app. It exploded in popularity, reaching **90 million monthly active users** by 2024 and becoming the second most-used generative AI product globally.

**2022:** Raised **$340 million** in external equity—its first venture capital round—with investors including Ryan Reynolds and Eric Schmidt. Acquired _Evernote_ and _FiLMiC Pro_.

**2023:** Integrated Evernote, increased prices, trimmed the free tier, and restored profitability. Headcount grew to 400, with 75% in technical roles.

**2024:** Acquired _Meetup_, _StreamYard_ (from Hopin), _Issuu_, _WeTransfer_ (valued at €716 million), and _Brightcove_ (a Nasdaq-listed U.S. video platform). Raised an additional **$155 million**, cementing unicorn status.

**2025:** Acquired _Komoot_, a German outdoor adventure app. With an expansive portfolio and steady revenue streams, the company is seen as a strong IPO candidate, potentially pursuing a dual listing in Milan and New York.

### The Acquisition Playbook: Buy, Optimize, Monetize

Bending Spoons’ strategy is distinct: it **acquires proven yet under-optimized digital products**, applies its technical and business acumen, and scales them profitably. CEO Luca Ferrari calls this model the lovechild of "**Berkshire Hathaway and Google**." The company actively seeks apps with established user bases but poor monetization, cost inefficiencies, or strategic neglect by prior owners.

After acquisition, a **"learning phase"** begins: teams dissect the product's code, UX, business model, and customer feedback. Post-analysis, they roll out enhancements—often dramatic—ranging from AI-powered features to UI overhauls. Unlike traditional private equity, which often cuts and holds, Bending Spoons **builds and scales**.

Recent examples:

*   **WeTransfer:** After acquiring this file-sharing giant, Bending Spoons laid off 75% of its workforce, integrated it with other tools, and preserved brand strength while ensuring profitability. 
*   **Komoot:** A beloved European route-planning app with 45 million users, Komoot represents Bending Spoons’ move into outdoor tech and adventure. The acquisition underscores their ability to spot niche products with global potential.

### Revenue Model: Scalable, Subscription-Based SaaS

Bending Spoons operates on a **highly scalable subscription-based model**, with most of its apps following the freemium structure—offering basic functionality for free and encouraging users to upgrade for more features. This strategy is central to its success:

*   _Remini_ offers weekly and annual subscriptions for full access to its AI photo-enhancing features.
*   _Splice_ and _FiLMiC Pro_ transitioned to subscription-only models under Bending Spoons.
*   _Evernote_ was aggressively monetized by limiting its free tier and raising prices post-acquisition.
    

This business model generates **high gross margins**, cultivates **predictable recurring revenue**, and allows **cross-subsidization across the app portfolio**. Each new subscriber adds marginal cost, yet substantial profit, creating an engine for sustained growth. In 2023, the company generated **392 million in revenue**, up from $162 million in 2022—a 2.5x year-over-year increase.

What sets this model apart is Bending Spoons’ mastery of **user acquisition and conversion optimization**. It leverages data analytics, A/B testing, and app store optimization to maximize user lifetime value across different geographies and demographics. With over 100 million active users monthly, even a small increase in conversion rate or average revenue per user (ARPU) significantly impacts total revenue.

### Financing and Financial Performance

Bending Spoons has demonstrated **uncommon financial discipline and creativity** in scaling without early reliance on venture capital. Until 2022, the company was largely bootstrapped, funding operations through:

*   **Founder savings and early profits**
*   **Over $500 million in debt** strategically deployed for acquisitions
*   **Secondary share sales and reinvestment of operating income**
    

This financial structure preserved control and avoided early dilution, a rarity among tech startups. It allowed Bending Spoons to grow profitably, acquiring and integrating over a dozen businesses before taking its first institutional funding round.

When the company finally raised equity in 2022, it did so on the back of solid fundamentals. Since then:

*   **2022:** Revenue ∼$162M, net loss of €23M (due to acquisition costs)
*   **2023:** Revenue ∼$392M, net profit €22.75M
*   **2024 (Projected):** Revenue exceeding $500M, with rising EBITDA margins and positive cash flow from all major product lines
    

Its hybrid approach—combining SaaS-like recurring revenue with PE-style disciplined investment—sets a benchmark not just for Italy, but for all of Europe. As of 2025, Bending Spoons is arguably **the most financially sound and diversified consumer tech company in Europe**.

### Company Culture: Radical Simplicity Meets Global Excellence

Bending Spoons deliberately resists Silicon Valley norms:

*   **Headquartered in Milan**, proving world-class tech companies can grow outside traditional hubs
*   Named one of **Italy’s best workplaces**, with a young, international, English-speaking team  
*   Practices **"radical simplicity"**: avoiding overengineering, favoring fast iterations, and building stable systems that don’t require on-call firefighting 
*   **Flat organizational structure**: No formal titles or bonuses; engineers and PMs are empowered with full ownership
    

This culture, combined with technical excellence, allows Bending Spoons to operate over **100 high-impact apps with just ~400 people**. Its cultural model creates agility, attracts top talent, and ensures every team member contributes directly to product performance and business results.

### What Lies Ahead

With multiple high-profile acquisitions, a robust engineering backbone, and a loyal user base, Bending Spoons is now a **prime IPO candidate**. CEO Luca Ferrari has stated that a dual listing—possibly on the NYSE and Milan Stock Exchange—is under consideration. The goal? Access deep capital markets while proving a tech giant can be built from an “unlikely place.”

If it maintains its current trajectory, Bending Spoons could become **Europe’s most iconic consumer tech company**. It has the potential to rival global peers not just through innovation, but through **financial discipline, operational excellence, and an unbeatable acquisition strategy**.

### Final Thoughts

In a world where most startups follow a playbook—build, fund, burn, scale—Bending Spoons rewrote the rules. With an eye for undervalued products, a relentless focus on optimization, and a disciplined approach to scaling, it has built a global empire from Milan—one acquisition at a time.

For Europe, Bending Spoons is more than a unicorn; it is a **symbol of what is possible**. It proves that visionary leadership, disciplined execution, and product excellence can flourish in a continent too often overlooked in tech conversations.

Bending Spoons is not just a unicorn. It is **a blueprint** for the next generation of European tech companies.
