Bending Spoons has transformed from a bootstrapped Italian startup into a **€4.9 billion tech conglomerate** through a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on buying, optimizing, and permanently owning software companies. Their approach combines **operational rigor**, **technical integration**, and **financial engineering** to turn established apps into highly profitable assets. Here’s how they do it, using WeTransfer as the prime example.

The WeTransfer Transformation: A Case Study in Efficiency
---------------------------------------------------------

WeTransfer’s €750 million acquisition in 2024 exemplifies Bending Spoons’ playbook. Pre-acquisition, WeTransfer was profitable but inefficient:

*   **Revenue**: €132 million (52% ads, 48% subscriptions) 
*   **Users**: 80 million monthly actives, 600,000 subscribers 
*   **Staff**: 350 employees 
*   **EBITDA margin**: 25%
    

Bending Spoons executed a three-part optimization:

1.  **Staff Reduction**:
    *   Cut 75% of staff (from 350 to 88) by centralizing operations.    
    *   Saved €40–50 million annually by leveraging their 450-engineer team[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bending-spoons-acquisition-strategy-wetransfer-case-nicola-verrini-uts8f)[5](https://verved.ai/blog/how-bending-spoons-mastered-product-acquisition).   
2.  **Pricing Power**:
    *   Increased subscription prices by 40%, adding €25 million in annual revenue with minimal churn due to strong brand loyalty[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bending-spoons-acquisition-strategy-wetransfer-case-nicola-verrini-uts8f)[2](https://www.techradar.com/pro/bending-spoons-snaps-up-wetransfer).     
3.  **Technical Overhaul**:
    *   Rewrote legacy code and migrated to Bending Spoons’ infrastructure, reducing hosting costs by 30–40%[4](https://cloud.google.com/transform/bending-spoons-cloud-ai-built-apps-100-million-users)[5](https://verved.ai/blog/how-bending-spoons-mastered-product-acquisition).

**Results**:

*   EBITDA margin surged from 25% to 72%.  
*   Payback period: 6.6 years on the €750 million investment[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bending-spoons-acquisition-strategy-wetransfer-case-nicola-verrini-uts8f).
    

The Acquisition Formula: Targeting for Success
----------------------------------------------

Bending Spoons targets companies meeting five criteria:

1.  **Established user bases** with high switching costs (e.g., WeTransfer’s 80M users).
2.  **Subscription-driven revenue** for predictable cash flow. 
3.  **Strong brands** enabling pricing power. 
4.  **Operational inefficiencies** (e.g., technical debt, bloated staff). 
5.  **Attractive multiples** (3–6x revenue)[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bending-spoons-acquisition-strategy-wetransfer-case-nicola-verrini-uts8f)[6](https://www.mandalorepartners.com/research/how-bending-spoons-is-rebuilding-digital-classics-a-blueprint-for-european-innovation-powerhouses).
    

Their portfolio includes Evernote, Meetup, and Brightcove, generating **€800 million combined revenue** from 450 million monthly users.

Technical Integration: The Hidden Engine
----------------------------------------

Bending Spoons doesn’t just cut costs—it rebuilds products:

*   **Legacy System Analysis**: Audits identify performance bottlenecks. 
*   **Architectural Reconstruction**: Core software is rewritten using modern frameworks.
*   **AI Integration**: Deploys proprietary models (e.g., Remini’s photo enhancement) across apps[4](https://cloud.google.com/transform/bending-spoons-cloud-ai-built-apps-100-million-users).Their AI infrastructure processes **40 million photos daily** using 2,000 GPUs, enabling features competitors can’t match[4](https://cloud.google.com/transform/bending-spoons-cloud-ai-built-apps-100-million-users).
    

Financial Engineering: Maximizing Returns
-----------------------------------------
*   **Leverage**: Maintains 4.0–5.0x EBITDA leverage (rated B+ by S&P[3](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/jp/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3322468)).  
*   **Cost of Capital**: 9.5% weighted average (11% equity, 6.1% debt after tax)[3](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/jp/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3322468).
*   **Arbitrage Model**: Buys at 3–6x revenue, integrates into a platform valued at 15x+ EBITDA[3](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/jp/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3322468)[6](https://www.mandalorepartners.com/research/how-bending-spoons-is-rebuilding-digital-classics-a-blueprint-for-european-innovation-powerhouses).**Portfolio ROI**: €1.5 billion deployed, €4.9 billion current value (227% return)[6](https://www.mandalorepartners.com/research/how-bending-spoons-is-rebuilding-digital-classics-a-blueprint-for-european-innovation-powerhouses).
    

Why This Model Works
--------------------

Bending Spoons’ "own forever" philosophy—inspired by Berkshire Hathaway—focuses on **long-term value**, not quick flips[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bending-spoons-acquisition-strategy-wetransfer-case-nicola-verrini-uts8f). Their Milan-based team combines:
*   **Data-driven decisions** (e.g., Minerva AI predicts user lifetime value[4](https://cloud.google.com/transform/bending-spoons-cloud-ai-built-apps-100-million-users)).  
*   **Centralized tech infrastructure** for economies of scale.
*   **No exit pressure**, allowing patient optimization.
    

The Bottom Line
---------------

Bending Spoons proves that **acquisition-led growth** can outperform organic scaling in fragmented software markets. By targeting inefficiencies in strong brands—like WeTransfer—they turn good products into cash-generating powerhouses. Their formula: **buy, optimize, hold, repeat**. For founders, this offers a compelling exit; for investors, a scalable European tech success[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bending-spoons-acquisition-strategy-wetransfer-case-nicola-verrini-uts8f)[6](https://www.mandalorepartners.com/research/how-bending-spoons-is-rebuilding-digital-classics-a-blueprint-for-european-innovation-powerhouses)
